## <a name="Mission"></a>Mission
Our mission is to spread awareness of the prevalence of human trafficking, and thereby raise funding for organizations that serve the victims of this practice.

## <a name="how"></a>How It Works

Victims of human trafficking are invisible. They can be the faces that we pass on the street, without us even realizing. Anyone can be a victim of sex trafficking, but the people most at risk are women and girls who come from marginalized communities: those who have survived sexual assault, war or conflict, homelessness, and social discrimination. To honor these victims and survivors, this project asks you to look around at your environment and see the faces that are hidden there. Upload the photos you take, upvote your favorites in the gallery, and donate to Safehouse to help victims of sex trafficking. 

###### Step 1: Get tagged by a friend

Someone tags you in a post on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.

###### Step 4: User shares their picture and the mission on their social media

Our project relies on the viral spreading of the cute and funny hidden faces photos to bring awareness to a serious cause and rally support.

###### Step 5: User donates to SafeHouse

SafeHouse's biggest challenge in providing adquate care for victims is getting unrestricted funding. Donations from Hidden Faces hopes to address this issue by engaging millenials to not only play and upload photos but to make a financial contribution.

###### Step 6: User looks through hidden faces picture gallery and votes for their favorite
